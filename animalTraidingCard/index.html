				<p class = "description">The giant panda is a bear that lives in China. It has black and white fur, which makes it easy to recognize. Pandas mostly eat bamboo, which is their favorite food. They are calm and gentle animals. Because there are not many pandas left in the wild, they are very special and need protection.</p>
