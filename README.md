# Web-Development-Journey
here is my journey to learn web dev using HTML,CSS,javaScript and python 



what i learned for basics :
1. Define the structure and content of a web page with HTML
2. Add style to a page using CSS
3. Tell the difference between CSS syntax and HTML syntax, while using the two side-by-side
4. Identify exactly what each part of the code does (such as what an HTML element is and how it works)
5. Use developer tools to look into the inner workings of real, live web sites
6. Debug or troubleshoot my code when things go wrong
